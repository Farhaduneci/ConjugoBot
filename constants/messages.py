❌ I'm sorry, I couldn't find any verbs that match your input.
If you're sure that the verb exists, it might not be an irregular verb.

Here is the general process of conjugating a regular verb:

- Add the ending -ed to the base form of the verb.

For example, the base form of the verb "cook" is "cook".
When we add -ed to cook, it becomes "cooked".
